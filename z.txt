Trigger
 - Remote trigger = manually triggered by them.(JENKINS_URL/job/dev/build?token=TOKEN_NAME. If we use this link in browser it will automatically triggered after we leave them. )
 - Periodic trigger = automatically triggered by cron ***** (https://crontab.guru/)

Regular Expression (regex101.com) = it means same more jobs having access to the people. (eg: software developer, cloud developer, tester, production.so if I want developer , I just give the string like "/.dev *". so, it takes software developer and cloud developer, like that you want to change whatever it may be...)
 - Developer = .dev *
          .  = it indicates starting with dot
         dev = starting these words 
          *  = it takes after the full words
