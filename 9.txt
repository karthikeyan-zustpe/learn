## üìù **PowerShell Comments (Basics)**

PowerShell supports:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Single-Line Comments**

Use the `#` symbol. Anything after `#` on the line is **ignored**.

```powershell
# This is a single-line comment
Write-Output "Hello, PowerShell!"  # Inline comment after code
```

> ‚úîÔ∏è Use these to explain commands or make notes.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Multi-Line (Block) Comments**

Use `<#` to **start** and `#>` to **end** a block of comments.

```powershell
<#
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span several lines.
Useful for script headers or explanations.
#>
Write-Output "This runs after the comment."
```

> ‚úîÔ∏è Great for documenting entire sections or scripts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Script with Comments

```powershell
# Define a greeting
$name = "Alice"  # You can change this to your name

<#
The line below will print a greeting.
We use string interpolation to include the name.
#>
Write-Output "Hello, $name!"
```
