Great! You're asking for **basic comments in Python**, explained clearly and line-by-line. Here's everything you need to get started:

## üêç Python Comments (Basics)

Python supports:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Single-Line Comments**

```python
# This is a single-line comment
```

### üß† Explanation:

| Part                            | Meaning                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `#`                             | Tells Python to **ignore the rest of the line** ‚Äî it's a comment. |
| `This is a single-line comment` | Text for humans ‚Äî Python won‚Äôt run it.                            |

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Inline Comments**

```python
x = 5  # This sets the variable x to 5
```

### üß† Explanation:

| Part                            | Meaning                               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `x = 5`                         | Code that assigns the value 5 to `x`. |
| `#`                             | Starts a comment.                     |
| `This sets the variable x to 5` | Explains what the line of code does.  |

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Multi-Line Comments (Using # on each line)**

Python doesn‚Äôt have a built-in multi-line comment block like some languages, so you use `#` on each line:

```python
# This is a multi-line comment
# You write a new # on each line
# Python ignores each line
```

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Docstrings (Triple Quotes for Documentation)**

Although not technically a comment, **docstrings** are often used like multi-line comments inside functions, classes, or modules:

```python
def greet():
    """
    This function prints a greeting.
    You can use triple quotes for docstrings.
    """
    print("Hello!")
```

### üß† Explanation:

* Python uses `"""triple quotes"""` or `'''single triple quotes'''` to create **docstrings**.
* These are used for documentation and can be accessed with `help()`.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Type                | Syntax               | Purpose                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Single-line comment | `# comment`          | Brief note or explanation  |
| Inline comment      | `code  # comment`    | Explain specific code line |
| Multi-line comment  | `# line1`, `# line2` | Longer explanations        |
| Docstring           | `""" text """`       | Document functions/classes |

---

Would you like a small Python script that uses all these comment types together for practice?
